📌 Project Overview

This project implements a hybrid deep learning intrusion detection and prevention system for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments using the NSL-KDD dataset.

The framework integrates:<br>
	-	✅ CNN for spatial feature extraction<br>
	-	✅ BiLSTM for temporal dependency learning<br>
	-	✅ Attention Mechanism for feature importance weighting<br>
	-	✅ Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning) for adaptive intrusion prevention<br>
	-	✅ Hash-Chain Audit Logging for tamper-proof security auditing<br>

The system not only detects cyber-attacks but also dynamically decides mitigation actions such as blocking or isolating malicious sources.
